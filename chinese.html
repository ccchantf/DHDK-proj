<p>How many Chinese cuisines are there? The most influential and typical known by the public are the 
"8 Chinese Cuisines". Actually Chinese cuisine has more than 8 genres. China is large and <span class="chara">the climate, 
ingredients, history and dining customs vary from place to place, leading to the differences in cooking 
methods and dish flavors</span> and forming the different cuisines.</p>

<p>As early as the Shang Dynasty (17th century BC - 1046 BC) and Zhou Dynasty (1046 - 256 BC), China's 
dietary culture has taken shape. <span class="history">In the Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960 - 1279 AD), 
the northern and southern food already had their own characteristics</span>: generally <span class="chara">sweet in south and 
salty in north</span>. By the <span class="history">early Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911 AD), four most influential cuisines prevailed. </span>
What are the four main styles of Chinese cuisine at that time? They are cuisines of Shandong, Sichuan, 
Guangdong and Jiangsu respectively. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, the four new cuisines - Zhejiang 
cuisine, Fujian cuisine, Hunan cuisine, and Anhui cuisine appeared; together with former four cuisines, 
they were listed as "8 Chinese Cuisines".</p>

<p>Today, the hot and spicy Sichuan and Hunan cuisines are the most popular in China; the Cantonese 
cuisine with light taste and delicate cooking methods is not only sought after in China, but also 
popular around the world.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Further Reading on Chinese Cuisine History</p>

<p><span class="history">In Shang and Zhou Dynasties, China had developed its dietary culture. By Tang and Song Dynasties, 
the dining customs in the north and south developed respectively.</span> People in North liked sweet food 
while in South liked salty food.</p>

<p><span class="history">During the Southern Song Dynasty (1127 - 1279 AD), the northerners moved to the south</span> in large numbers. 
Gradually, the northern food culture had influenced the south and formed its own style in the south. 
<span class="history">By the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese cuisine was divided into Beijing style, Jiangsu style and 
Cantonese style</span>. Beijing-style dishes were salty, and the Jiangsu-style and Cantonese-style dishes were 
sweet.</p>

<p>By the early Qing Dynasty, there existed four most influential cuisines: Shandong cuisine, Sichuan 
cuisine, Cantonese cuisine and Jiangsu cuisine.</p>

<p>Later, the dining habits of various parts of China developed considerably. <span class="history">Sichuan cuisine was further 
divided into Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine. Cantonese cuisine was divided into Cantonese cuisine 
and Fujian cuisine. Jiangsu style cuisine was divided into Jiangsu cuisine, Zhejiang cuisine and Anhui 
cuisine. By late Qing Dynasty, Sichuan, Cantonese, Hunan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui 
cuisines gradually become the most influential and popular, finally forming "8 Chinese Cuisines".</span></p>
